# AA/HU Pair Session Instructions

You have likely just received a request to join a "Pairing Session" with an engineer from Acklen Avenue or Hero Unit. These instructions are meant to help you set up your environment and get you ready for success in this next step in the vetting process.

## Before the Pair Session

1. Unless the programming language/technology was chosen by AA or HU, you should decide on a language in which you would like to do this pair session. We suggest you choose the language in which you feel most comfortable.
2. Sign up for a free account at [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) which is an online IDE. If your chosen language is [not supported](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/) by GitPod, then please choose another language.
3. Create a new git repository at github or gitlab.
4. Access your git repository with GitPod
5. Set up your project in GitPod with...
  - a docker file that sets up the correct environment to develop in your selected language
  - a folder structure for code files including separate sections for production code and unit tests
  - two unit tests that interact with production code:
    - one unit test that FAILS for the [right reasons](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2010/04/05/red-for-the-right-reason-fail-by-assertion-not-by-anything-else/)
    - one unit test that PASSES for the right reasons
  - a way to run the unit tests, whether from the command line or using built-in GitPod tools 
  - Enable auto-save so that all viewers can see updates in almost-real-time.
6. In GitPod, go to Workspace > Share Running Workspace and copy the url.
7. Send the workspace url to us by replying to the last email at least 24 hours before the scheduled Pairing Session.
