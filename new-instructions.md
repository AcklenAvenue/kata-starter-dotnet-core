# AA/HU Pair Session Instructions

You have likely just received a request to join a "Pairing Session" with an engineer from Acklen Avenue or Hero Unit. These instructions are meant to help you set up your environment and get you ready for success in this next step in the vetting process.

## Before the Pair Session

1. Unless the programming language/technology was chosen by AA or HU, you should decide on a language in which you would like to do this pair session. We suggest you choose the language in which you feel most comfortable.
2. Sign up for a free account at [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) which is an online IDE. If your chosen language is [not supported](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/) by GitPod, then please choose another language.
3. Create a new git repository at github or gitlab.
4. Access your git repository with GitPod
5. Set up your project with...
  - separate sections for production code and unit tests.
  - a way to run the unit tests using some easy method
  - one failing unit test and one passing unit test to prove your test runner is working. Both unit tests should execute code from your production code section.
  - Enable auto-save so that all viewers can see updates in almost-real-time.

## Starting the Pair Session

You will need to start your workspace and share it using a special link with your evaluator. 

1. In GitPod, go to Workspace > Share Running Workspace and copy the url.
2. Send the workspace url to your evaluator using email or meeting chat.
