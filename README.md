# Welcome to the Kata Starter for .NET Core

## Preparing:
Your pair interview will be conducted in .NET Core and C#. If you're not experienced with C#, no worries. This interview will not judge your ability in one language or technology, but how you manage yourself in a situation with new concepts and techniques.
