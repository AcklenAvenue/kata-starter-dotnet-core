## Modify Widget Price

Build a complete, deployable, full-stack feature.

### Rules:
* Follow strict Red-Green-Refactor.
  * Write one spec at a time.
  * All previously passing specs must continue to pass
  * All new specs must fail for the right reasons before making them pass
* Use the tech stack defined by your team/company (Acklen/HU: ASP.NET Core, React)
* Verbalize thoughts and code
* No copy/pasta
* Feature-related code in front and back ends should have 100% test coverage without writing tests after production code
   
### Spec(s)
* Given an existing widget and an admin user, when modifying the widget price then it should reflect the change and notify the widget owner of the change.

### Technique and Form
What do we want people to learn from the practice of this kata?

* How to TDD an entire feature from top to bottom
* Front-End
  * Flux architecture in front-end
  * Component-Driven Development in front-end using Storybook
* Back-End
  * CQRS Architecture in back-end
  * Rich domain modeling and encapsulation
  * Event sourcing and domain events
